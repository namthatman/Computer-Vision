# Computer-Vision
## Fashion Class Classification
A CNN model is to classify clothing images into 10 fashion classes includes T-shirt/top, Trouser, Dress, Sneaker, etc.

## Face Recognition with OpenCV
A simple face recognition built with OpenCV to detect human faces from the webcam. Human frontal-face and eyes will be detected on real-time. BONUS: A happiness recognition can detect happiness (smiles) on human faces.

## Object Detection with SSD
An Object detection built with SSD to detect several objects including human and animals. Objects will be detected at every frames of the video. BONUS: detect some epic horses galloping.

## Image Creation with GANs
An Image creation built with Deep Convolutional GANs to generate fake images of several objects including animal, car, airplane, ship, etc. The dataset used for training is the CIFAR-10 consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes.
