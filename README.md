# Computer-Vision
## Face Recognition with OpenCV
A simple face recognition built with OpenCV to detect human faces from the webcam. Human frontal-face and eyes will be detected on real-time. BONUS: A happiness recognition can detect happiness (smiles) on human faces.

## Object Detection with SSD
An object detection built with SSD to detect several objects including human and animals. Objects will be detected at every frames of a video. BONUS: detect some epic horses galloping.
